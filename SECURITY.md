# Security Status: ai-logistics-automation-hub

## 🔍 Alignment with Hector Standards
- **Standardized README**: ⚠️ Partial. README is comprehensive but may benefit from explicit Problem/Solution/Tech Stack/Operational Logic headings.
- **Core Identity**: ✅ Focused on AI-driven logistics automation.
- **Operational Logic Detail**: ✅ High.

## 🛡️ Current Security State
Spring Boot automation system with Groq AI integration.

**Secrets Management:**
- All credentials (Groq API key, SMTP username/password, Slack webhook URL) are loaded exclusively from environment variables.
- `application.yml` contains **no hardcoded secrets and no fallback defaults** for sensitive values. Startup will fail fast if a required variable is missing — this is intentional.
- For local development, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in real values, and run via `spring-dotenv` (included as a dependency) or export manually. The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
- For Docker, use: `docker run --env-file .env ...`
- For CI/CD, inject secrets via GitHub Actions encrypted secrets or your platform's secret manager.

**Architecture:**
- Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) facilitates component-level security auditing.
- Constructor injection used throughout — no hidden field injection.

**SAST/DAST:** Not explicitly configured in this repository.

## 🚀 Security Roadmap
1. **Docker hardening**: Optimize the base image to reduce attack surface (e.g., use `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine`).
2. **Dependency scanning**: Add GitHub Actions workflow with Snyk or Dependabot to audit Maven libraries.
3. **AI input validation**: Sanitize prompts sent to the Groq API to prevent prompt injection attacks.
4. **Input validation**: Add `@Valid` + `@NotBlank` constraints on DTOs using `spring-boot-starter-validation`.
